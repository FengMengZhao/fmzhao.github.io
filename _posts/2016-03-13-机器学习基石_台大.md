### The learning problem

machine learning:improving some performance meachure with experience computed from data

machine learning:use data compute hypothesis 'g' that approximates target 'f'

data mining:use huge data to find property that is interesting

artificial inteligence:compute something that shows intelligent behavior

statistics:use data to make inference about an unknown process

Some Use Scenarios

1) when human cannot program the system mannually--navigating on Mars

2) when human cannot define the solution easily--speech/visual recognition

3) when needing rapid decisions that human cannot do--high-frequency trading

4) when needing to be user-oriented in a massive scale--consumer-targeted marketing

> Given a computer a fish, you feed it for a day; teach it how to fish, you need it for a lifetime.

#### Key Essence of Machine Learning

1) exists some "underlying pattern" to be learned--so "performance measure" can be improved

2) but no programmable(easy) definition --so ML is needed

3) somehow there is data about the pattern --so ML has some inputs to learn from

### Learning to answer Yes/No

#### PLA(perceptron learning algorithm)

> 可以证明在线性可分的情况下PLA最终是会停止的

#### Linear Separability，线性可分

如果数据不是线性可分的或者不知道是否是线性可分的情况下，我们可以使用Pocket Algorithm算法来找出还不错的'g'来近似'f'

### Types of learning

Learning with Different Output Space y(不同的输出空间):

* binary classification: y={-1, +1}

* multiclass classfication: y={1,2,...,k}

* regression: y=R

* structured learning: y=structures

Learning with different Data Label y:

* supervised learning(监督学习)

* unsupervised learning(非监督学习)，for example:clustering(聚类)

* semi-supervised learning(半监督学习)

* reinforcement learning(增强学习)，例如：使用惩罚和奖励来训练宠物狗的动作

Learning with differnt protocol

* batch learning:'duck feeding'

* online learning:'passive sequential'

* active learning:'question asking(sequentially)'

Learning with differnt input space

* concrete

* raw

* abstract

### Feasibility of Learning

feasible——if we can remove bad data for all the hypothesis
